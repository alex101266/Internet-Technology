1.  It appears that all the known bugs were fixed for the final version of this code.
2.  The only individuals that worked on this project are those listed under number 0. 
3.  Shademhr was more familiar with socket programming than I was, so I had to consult multiple videos, websites, 
and documentation to help understand how to complete the server file. Some examples of resources used were:
    "Python - Binding and Listening with Sockets" from GeeksforGeeks.org
    "Socket Programming HowTo" from docs.python.org
    "Python Socket Programming Tutorial" by Tech with Tim from youtube
    "Socket Programming in Python(Simplified) - in 7 minutes!" by Kindson the Tech Pro from youtube
    "Sockets Tutorial with Python 3 part 1, 2, 3" by sentdex from youtube
I tried to code this project myself initially and have Shademhr correct any mistakes. My code had problems in some areas,
such as assuming that the files were sent from the client rather than the strings themselves, so he corrected it. 
He also troubleshoot the code and made sure it functioned properly. At one point he had a connection
error along the lines of "No connection could be made because the target machine activity refused it." 
He circumvented it by using his pc name instead of the ip. Overall, not having the server file explained made this
first project exceptionally difficult and required mostly outside sources to be able to complete it. We each spent
a few days working on it, about 2-3 hours each day.
