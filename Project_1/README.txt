1.  There appear to be no known bugs for this final version of code.

2.      The only individuals that worked on this project are those listed under number 0. Code was reused from
    our own Project_0. The references used were as follows:
        "Here is how to get the first two characters of a string in Python" from pythonhow.com
        "The Ones' complement operator ~ in python a tutorial" from twiserandom.com
        "Understanding ISO-8859-1/UTF-8" from mincong.io
        "Python 3.11.4 documentation" from docs.python.org
        "Test.py" from canvas
        "HW1" from canvas
    The overall concept of the project was confusing so I consulted the professor during class to answer some
    related questions pertaining to checksumming. Initially, I believed it would be far more complicated
    to determine the checksum, having to edit both client and server simulatenously. The professor clarified
    and made the project clear and simple to complete. I provided the initial blueprint for the code and 
    Shademhr was able to test and fix any issues with it.

3.      The main problem with this project was the conceptual aspect, which wasn't clear until class the day 
    this was due. Prior to that, we spent 2 hours each day of the weekend trying to figure it out, to no avail.
    Once we did figure it out though, it was fairly quick and completed in about 2-3 hours. A large portion
    of the code was reused from Project_0 so there wasn't a lot of connection testing required. The main bugs
    occurred with the different symbols. Lines 1, 4, and 6 were showing the intended results but the rest 
    were creating errors while decoding. This was fixed by transitioning from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1 formatting.
    Another issue that arose was timing. Project_1 being in the same weekend as exam prep made things
    unnecessarily stressful. Overall, I think the instructions for this project could have been improved with 
    a bit more detail; They were somewhat vague and short. Once we figured it out though, it was a 
    relatively quick project.
