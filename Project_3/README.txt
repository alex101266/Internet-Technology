1. There appear to be no known bugs for this final version of code.

2.  The only individuals that worked on this project are those listed under number 0. The references used were as follows:
        https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321
        Lecture 8: Application Layer on Canvas
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/

3.  There were honestly not many problems when developing the code for this project and it only
took a couple hours on a Sunday after completing HW3 for information on how SMTP works. Some of
the error checking was done on Monday 8/14 but it was easy to test because we knew it worked 
based on if the email in email.txt was sent or not. There was an appropriate amount of time
for this project.
